# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This project was developed and tested on the Google Chrome browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Assignment Reflection

Major goals were to reduce api calls necessary (loading all dogs at once on app load and saving the image sources once a dog breed's api was loaded).
